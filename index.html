                Ohio State challenges me in many ways and offers unprecedented
                diversity of opportunity. The experiences that I've been
                blessed with thus far have been a result of excellent
                instructors, long nights, and supportive peers. With about 3
                years at this school under my belt, I've learned that you
                can't take anything for granted because it'll be gone before
                you know it. During my freshman year, I was handed the burden
                of starting a new chapter of a
                <a href="https://www.betasigmapsi.org/">fraternity</a>, and
                while it has proven to be no easy task, the rewards that I've
                reaped as a result of my hard work have been immense.

              The past summer as a software engineering intern at JPMorgan Chase was an incredible opportunity.
              I had the privilege of working on a small team to develop a technical solution for a
              <a href='http://techcorps.org/'>nonprofit</a> aligned with JPMorgan Chase. We developed a webapp
              that provided the nonprofit administrators with the ability to conduct their programs much more
              efficiently. Our tool allowed them to signiciantly boost their outreach and communication to their
              target audience. I was entirely responsible for developing the frontend, written in TypeScript with
              React framework. The app was served on a Python Flask backend and used a MongoDB cloud cluster (I think
              it's called Atlas!) for storage. I also had the opportunity to work intimately with some of JPMC's
              internal web frameworks and data visualization tools (services closest to Apache Kafka and
              <a href='https://perspective.finos.org/Finos'>Finos Perspective</a>).
            </p>
              <p class="pSize">
                I am very grateful to have spent the summer with JPMorgan Chase and I'm looking forward
                to applying the experience gained in other professional capacities.

              Hosted by OSU's
              Hack OHI/O Club, I developed a project with Microsoft's Azure Services, specifically
              working with the Computer Vision suite. I was responsible
              for backend functionality, as well as integration with express between our React Native frontend
              and our Node.js backend, a timeless combo.
              We used Azure's Image Tagging service to populate our database
              with image data (in this case, clothing), and then used
              our own recommendation algorithm to give the user a recommended
              outfit to wear for the day, depending on weather and formality.
              We won Best New to Hack, since it was our entire team's first
              Hack OHI/O Hackathon, as well as half of our team never participating in any programming event before.

                <a href="https://psychology.osu.edu/people/prakash.30">Dr. Ruchika Prakash</a>, who was looking to
                expand her 5-year research study

                  mindfulness</a>
                on aging seniors. Her development team already established a
                working foundation to kickstart the study, but they needed
                help implementing scalability into the project.
                I developed back-end functionality for user self-enroll and
                an enhanced testing suite that
                will allow Dr. Prakash's study to grow to new heights.
